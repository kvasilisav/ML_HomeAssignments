# ML Home Assignments

This repository contains projects (home assignments) for the School of Quants Machine Learning course.

## Project 1
Classified 4 vehicle types (bus, van, 2 cars) from 2D silhouettes using 18 shape features.
This project covers:
- EDA
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, CatBoost; optimized hyperparameters.
Discovered that feature 'max.length_sapect_ratio' had the highest impact according to both RF and CatBoost feature importances. Logistic Regression model outperformed others after tuning.
